          <h3>The Elements of Typographic Style</h3>
          <p>by Robert Bringhurst</p>
          <p>
            Often referred to as "The Typographer's Bible," Chapter 6 of The
            Elements of Typographic Stylecovers Choosing and Combining Type.
            Bringhurst reminds us to "Choose faces that will survive, and if
            possible prosper, in the final screen conditions" and to "choose
            faces that suit the task as well as the subject." He tells us to
            "start with a single typographic family," but when the time comes to
            combine fonts, "balance the type optically more than
            mathematically."

            technical know-how. In the "fonts" section of the site Brown writes,
            "You may have noticed, there are lots of typefaces out there to
            choose among. Here you'll find the ones I prefer, and my reasons."

          <p>
            While not a typographer himself, Bringhurst is a poet, with a love

            honoring and respecting the written word -- through choosing and
            combining typefaces; striving for rhythm, proportion, and harmony;

          <h3>I Love Typography</h3>
          <p>by John Boardley</p>
          <p>
            From the website: I love Typography (ILT) was born on August 7,
            2007. It exists because I have a passion for typography, type
            design, and lettering, and for the words born of those disciplines.
            As a child I wondered why the teacher asked us to draw the letter a
            as an o with a tail, when in my books, the a’s had an extra bit at
            the top. This site aims to make the subject more accessible, to
            bring the study of typography to the masses, if you will. It's just
            about impossible to imagine a world without type, but at the same
            time type's ubiquity has most of us taking it for granted. So take a
            closer look." ilovetypography.com

          <h3>Love and Joy About Letters</h3>
          <p>by Ben Shahn</p>
          <p>
            Ben Shahn was a muralist, photographer, and printmaker whose work
            often including lettering. When he was 14, he was apprenticed to a
            lithographer. In Love and Joy About Letters he writes: "I discovered
            the Roman alphabet in all its elegance and its austere dignity, and
            I fell in love all over again with letters… Letters are quantities,
            and spaces are quantities, and only the eye and the hand can measure
            them. As in the ear and the sensibilities of the poet sounds and
            syllables and pauses are quantities, so in both cases are the
            balancing and forward movement of these quantities only a matter of
            skill and feeling and art."
