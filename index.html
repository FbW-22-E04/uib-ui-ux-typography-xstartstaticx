          <p>by Robert Bringhurst</p>
          <p>
            Often referred to as "The Typographer's Bible," Chapter 6 of
            <i><strong> The Elements of Typographic Style </strong></i> covers
            Choosing and Combining Type. Bringhurst reminds us to "Choose faces
            that will survive, and if possible prosper, in the final screen
            conditions" and to "choose faces that suit the task as well as the
            subject." He tells us to "start with a single typographic family,"
            but when the time comes to combine fonts, "balance the type
            optically more than mathematically."

            One of my favorite sites,
            <i><strong>Nice Web Type</strong></i> strikes a balance between
            typographic artistry and technical know-how. In the "fonts" section
            of the site Brown writes, "You may have noticed, there are lots of
            typefaces out there to choose among. Here you'll find the ones I
            prefer, and my reasons."

            Concerned with letters, text, and grids,
            <i><strong>Thinking with Type</strong></i> covers everything you
            need to know about working with text on the page. Lupton writes from
            experience as a typographer and a teacher, presenting the "rules" of
            typography with humor -- while backing them up with theory. The
            companion web site includes tips on creating hierarchy and grids,
            along with sample solutions.

            While not a typographer himself, Bringhurst is a poet, with a love
            for ideas and a love for the letters and words used to make ideas
            visible.
            <i><strong>The Elements of Typographic Style</strong></i> teaches
            the basics of honoring and respecting the written word -- through
            choosing and combining typefaces; striving for rhythm, proportion,
            and harmony; and designing typographic pages.

            From the website: <i><strong>I love Typography</strong></i> (ILT)
            was born on August 7, 2007. It exists because I have a passion for
            typography, type design, and lettering, and for the words born of
            those disciplines. As a child I wondered why the teacher asked us to
            draw the letter a as an o with a tail, when in my books, the a’s had
            an extra bit at the top. This site aims to make the subject more
            accessible, to bring the study of typography to the masses, if you
            will. It's just about impossible to imagine a world without type,
            but at the same time type's ubiquity has most of us taking it for
            granted. So take a closer look."

            Ben Shahn was a muralist, photographer, and printmaker whose work
            often including lettering. When he was 14, he was apprenticed to a
            lithographer. In
            <i><strong>Love and Joy About Letters</strong></i> he writes: "I
            discovered the Roman alphabet in all its elegance and its austere
            dignity, and I fell in love all over again with letters… Letters are
            quantities, and spaces are quantities, and only the eye and the hand
            can measure them. As in the ear and the sensibilities of the poet
            sounds and syllables and pauses are quantities, so in both cases are
            the balancing and forward movement of these quantities only a matter
            of skill and feeling and art."
